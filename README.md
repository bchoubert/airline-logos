# Airline Logos

Airline logos from 880+ biggest airlines according to OpenFlights!

Part of a bigger project, this repo lists all logos by icao.

2 formats are available : RAW (as captured on the internet) and PROCESSED (cleaned 500*300 logo).

I use this project in link with :
* [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/)
* Air-Data (soon, a project with data gathered from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/), [SkyBrary](https://www.skybrary.aero))
* Some future Dribbble shots

All content of this repo is NOT free of use. All logos are protected by copyright and cannot be used commercially.

Although, all logos here can be reused in personal and open-source projects.
